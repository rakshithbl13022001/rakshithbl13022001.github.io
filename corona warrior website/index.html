				<h1 class="heading1">CORONA WARRIORS </h1>
				<P class="para1">The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
					</br></br>
				While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front. Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors.

They have critical roles in diagnosis, containment and treatment, and their commitment to treat despite increased personal risks is essential for a successful public health response.1 Frontline workers have been experiencing high work volume, personal risk and societal pressure to meet extraordinary demands for healthcare.</p>

					<p class='paragraph'>Nurses have critical roles and responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. They will continue to be at the front line of patient care in hospitals and actively involved with evaluation and monitoring in the community. Nurses have to ensure that all patients acquire personalized, high-quality services irrespective of their infectious condition. They will also engage in planning for anticipated COVID-19–related outbreaks, which increase the demand for nursing and healthcare services that might overload systems.1</p>

					<img src="img7.jpg" class="b" alt="police" width="100%" height="">
					<p class='paragraph'>India’s public health response to Covid-19 engages two distinct police functions: the maintenance of public order and social service provision. After the lockdown order, police agencies aggressively enforced social distancing through patrolling vans, foot patrols, and vehicular checkpoints. These techniques follow a conventional “law and order” paradigm, which is engrained into the training and organisational culture of the police. In practical terms, lockdown enforcement means crowd control, which entails swift and aggressive action to seize control of public spaces.</p>

					<p class='paragraph'>Saving lives or driving the dead, Covid ambulance drivers slog it out without rest or raise.Walking the tightrope between life and death is something ambulance drivers pick up quickly on the job. They must arrive in time to take patients to the hospital before their conditions deteriorate. Then, they must transport bodies from the mortuary to a crematorium or cemetery just as swiftly, so as to not upset grieving families.</p>

					<p class='paragraph'>This communication gap is one factor that amplifies health inequities, especially during an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic. 

					This is where nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based education come in. NGOs are powerful facilitators of community-based education, and help ensure that information coming from groups with a broader focus, such as the World Health Organization and government agencies, reach and resonate in the communities they serve.</p>
